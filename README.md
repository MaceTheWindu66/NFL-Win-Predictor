# NFL-Win-Predictor
A stacking ensemble model that predicts if the home team will win or lose an NFL game.  
THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN PROGRESS! Looking to improve over the coming weeks.

## About this Project  
This project is a personal project facilitated by my Graduate Machine Learning class, where we were tasked to tackle an ML problem that we thought was interesting. I love sports, especially football, and building predictive models for sports I find to be a super fun challenge. Given the nature and unpredictability of football, I've given myself a target accuracy of 70%, which would be considered very good. Considering most models struggle to reliably get above 65%, I think this challenge will push me to seriously consider all different areas of engineering artificial intelligence to score higher and perform more efficiently.  

## Future Plans  
- Once this model gets to a reliable accuracy, I will be implementing it into the backend of a web-application so that anyone can access predictions at any time.
- Planning to engineer more features, such as wins over past 3 games, win % during season, avg QBR, etc.
