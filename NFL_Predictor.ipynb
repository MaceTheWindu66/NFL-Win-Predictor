        "This project was created as both a personal interest project and a project for my Graduate Machine Learning Course at WPI. I used a stacking ensemble model consisting of XGBoost, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression base learners, with a Logistic Regression meta learner. Using the nflreadpy api, which allows open access to multiple high-feature datasets, I was able to get a 73% accuracy score on test sets with this ensemble model. This notebook goes over my feature analysis / feature engineering,"

I find any machine learning problem related to sports to be super fun and interesting to tackle, as sports are notoriously unpredicatble. The NFL is no stranger to this volatility, and is part of the reason why I love the sport so much.\n",

        "The issue? The team stats dataset had two entries per game every week, one for the home and one for the away team. The home and away teams were not denoted by home and away in any way, so I essentially had to make a mask that included info about the team's home/away status and the corresponding game_id, then use that to merge the team_stats into the schedules dataset to get a giant dataset with team stats for both teams from each game."
