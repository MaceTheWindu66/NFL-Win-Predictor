        "This project was created as both a personal interest project and a project for my Graduate Machine Learning Course at WPI. I used a stacking ensemble model consisting of XGBoost, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression base learners, with a Logistic Regression meta learner. Using the nflreadpy api, which allows open access to multiple high-feature datasets, I was able to get a 73% accuracy score on test sets with this ensemble model. This notebook goes over my feature analysis / feature engineering,"

The home and away teams were not denoted by home and away in any way, so I essentially had to make a mask that included info about the team's home/away status and the corresponding game_id, then use that to merge the team_stats into the schedules dataset to get a giant dataset with team stats for both teams from each game."
